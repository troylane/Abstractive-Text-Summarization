    "# Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"justify\">The paper showcased how Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) can be usefully applied in text summarization and proposed a general framework for both extractive and abstractive models. The word 'extractive' implies that summary is generated by selecting salient sentences or phrases from the source text while 'abstractive' implies that sentences are paraphrased and restructured to compose the summary. </p>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"justify\">The authors have proven that BERT can be used successfuly for generating of abstract text summmaries on their test data.  However, it is important to note that the summarizer has been trained using the CNN news dataset and therefore may not produce accurate, or reflective results when using test data that is based on other types of data sets and use cases, i.e fiction books. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "For this research, a survey dataset has been generated to test the BERT-based model on this unique data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Context of the Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"justify\">Text summarization is important because of the need to condense documents into shorter versions while preserving most of it's meaning.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"justify\">It is no different for market survey industry.  Often times, surveys produce a lot of free text. Therefore, industry professionals and other stakeholders can greatly benefit from having accurate summaries of each survey question's responses.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"justify\">In the 'survey world', free-text responses to any given question can pose a challenge to automated text summarizers.  Often times, the text is abbreviated, poorly structured grammatically, and is redundant / repetitive in nature.  Therefore, this type of data has been selected to see how well Abstractive Text Summarization using pretrained models based on BERT, performs.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitation About other Approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"justify\">Other approaches employ special mechanisms (e.g. reinforment learning, multiple communicating encoders, copying mechanisms) other than the model's minimum requirement, to achieve good summarization.</p>\n",
    "<p align=\"justify\">They also do not utilize pre-trained embedding</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"justify\">The paper introduced a novel document-level encoder based on BERT, which is able to express the semantics of a document and obtain representation for its sentences. The solution achieved better results with minimum-requirement model without using any of the mechanisms mentioned in the limitation above.</p>"

    "# Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"justify\">BERT is a new language representation model which is trained with a masked language modeling and a “next sentence prediction” task on a corpus of 3,300M words.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"justify\">The input text is first preprocessed by inserting two special tokens. [CLS] is appended to the beginning of the text; the output representation of this token is used to aggregate information from the whole sequence (e.g., for classification tasks). And token [SEP] is inserted after each sentence as an indicator of sentence boundaries. The modified text is then represented as a sequence of tokens.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"justify\">Each token is assigned three kinds of embeddings: <I>token embeddings</I> indicate the meaning of each token, <I>segmentation embeddings</I> are used to discriminate between two sentences and <I>position embeddings </I> indicate the position of each token within the text sequence. These three embeddings are summed to a single input vector and fed to a bidirectional Transformer with multiple layers.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"justify\"> Although BERT has been used to fine-tune various NLP tasks, its application to summarization is not as straightforward.\n",
    "Since BERT is trained as a masked-language model, the output vectors are grounded to tokens instead of sentences, while in extractive summarization, most models manipulate sentence-level representations. Although segmentation embeddings represent different sentences in BERT, they only apply to sentencepair inputs, while in summarization they must encode and manipulate multi-sentential inputs. The figure below illustrates the proposed BERT architecture for SUMmarization (which is called BERTSUM).</p>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<p align=\"justify\">In order to represent individual sentences, external [CLS] tokens is inserted at the start of each sentence and each [CLS] symbol collects features for the sentence preceding it. Interval segment embeddings is also used to distinguish multiple sentences within a document. For each sentence, segment embedding EA or EB is assigned. For example, for document [sent1, sent2, sent3, sent4, sent5] embeddings [EA, EB, EA, EB, EA] will be assigned.\n",
    "This way, document representations are learned hierarchically where lower Transformer layers represent adjacent sentences, while higher layers, in combination with self-attention, represent multi-sentence discourse.\n",
    "Position embeddings in the original BERT model have a maximum length of 512;\n",
    "this limitation was overcome by adding more position embeddings that are initialized randomly and finetuned with other parameters in the encoder.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "![Bert for Summarization ](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/406a1ba1dee0a456af49e8687fbfd9989484855f/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f4d6a4375424d712e706e67 \"Bert for Summarization\") \n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">Architecture of the original BERT model (left) and BERTSUM (right). The sequence on top is the input document, followed by the summation of three kinds of embeddings for each token. The summed vectors are used\n",
    "as input embeddings to several bidirectional Transformer layers, generating contextual vectors for each token.\n",
    "BERTSUM extends BERT by inserting multiple [CLS] symbols to learn sentence representations and using interval segmentation embeddings (illustrated in red and green color) to distinguish multiple sentences. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<p align=\"justify\">To keep the presentation simple, we will focus on abstractive summarization. A standard encoder-decoder framework is used for abstractive summarization. The encoder is the pretrained BERTSUM and the decoder\n",
    "is a 6-layered Transformer initialized randomly.\n",
    "It is conceivable that there is a mismatch between the encoder and the decoder, since the encoder is pretrained while the decoder must be trained from scratch. This can make fine-tuning unstable; for example, the encoder might overfit\n",
    "the data while the decoder underfits, or vice versa.\n",
    "To circumvent this, a new fine-tuning schedule was designed which, separates the optimizers of the encoder and the decoder (Two Adam optimizers where used with beta values 0.9 and 0.999 respectively, each with different warmup steps and learning rates). This is based on the assumption that the pretrained encoder should be fine-tuned with a smaller learning rate and smoother decay (so that the encoder can be trained with more accurate gradients when the decoder is becoming stable).</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"justify\"> In addition, a two-stage fine-tuning approach was proposed, where they first fine-tuned the encoder on the extractive summarization task and then fine-tuned it on the abstractive summarization task. The two-stage approach is conceptually very simple, the model can take advantage of information shared between the two tasks, without fundamentally changing its architecture. \n",
    "The default abstractive model is named BERTSUMABS and the two-stage fine-tuned model is named BERTSUMEXTABS. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"justify\"> The model was evaluated on three benchmark datasets: CNN/DailyMail news highlights dataset, New York Times Annotated Corpus and XSum.\n",
    "\n",
    "CNN/DailyMail contains news articles and associated highlights, i.e., a few bullet points giving a brief overview of the article.\n",
    "NYT contains 110,540 articles with abstractive summaries.\n",
    "XSum contains 226,711 news articles accompanied with a one-sentence summary, answering the question “What is this article about?”.</p>\n"

    "<p allign = \"justify\">The authors demonstrated the influence of language  model  pre-training on text summarization tasks. By using the extractive summary based on pre-trained models as an input into generating abstractive summaries, in additon to using a 'two-staged fine tuning approach' to enhance the quality of the generated summaries. Using three large datasets state-of-the-art results were achieved.</p>\n",

    "<p allign = \"justify\">Moving on the new test dataset; the results of the abstractive text summarizer based on a BERT pre-trained language model are below. It can be seen that the model generated the summary with paraphases of the input dataset. However, the summary is not fully reflective of the full dataset and the gist of the responses of this ficticious dataset. There are main themes that are not included in the summarizer. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p allign = \"justify\">Furthemore, it appears that the summary is more 'negative' in tone, and leaves out the postive responses. While it is difficult to know why this is, it is beleived that this is a function of the CNN Daily Mail articles that were used to train BERT.  A lot of news articles are negative in nature in this day in age.</p>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<p allign = \"justify\">What is impressive is each sentence in the summary, the paraphrasing makes complete sense and is in fact based on survey responses and therefore is accurate.  However, the full summary does feel a bit fragmented. This is likely simply based on the input data content.  Additionaly, the summarizer presented the summary in a first-person context, further reflecting the input data.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p allign = \"justify\">To add some comparison, an extractive summary, using Gensim summarizer, has been included. See below. Recall that extractive summaries use phrases / sentences directly contained in the input document being summarized.  This version managed to present both the negative and positive themes that were included in the input data.  Furthermore, the summary is readable and understandable.  It does contain both views: first-person and third-party, which leads to some disjoint.  However it is easily interpretable.</p>"

Experimental results across three datasets show that the model achieves state-of-the-art results across the board under automatic and human-based evaluation protocols.\n",

    "<p allign = \"justify\">Based on a new test dataset created to mimic results of a survey - one that is challenging based on the grammar, amd redundancy or statements/ themes - BERT generated a 'decent' results, with some very promising results at a micro (sentence) level. </p> \n",
    "\n",
    "<p allign = \"justify\">A recommendation would be to train BERT using another large corpus data set, perhaps wiki, to see if there are improvements.  Furthermore, optimizing the models hyper-parameters may produce even more reflective summaries.</p>"
